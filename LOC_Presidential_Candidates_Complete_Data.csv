Deci .ration of the Empress of all the Rrffi.is.
It was towards the end of the last winter, that
the armaments by sea and land began to (Lew
themfHves in Sweden. Whlfpers were purposely
circulated in the kingdom, as if ItuHia meditated
an attack. 1: nrOpoftioa as thafe preparations
advanced, and as they believed they bad made an
impreflion ml ibme national spit its> the cabinet of
Stockholm l-egan to extend rhmors of the fame
kind, even to foreign courts. The empress has
the faristartion ter .learn that thele infinuatidns
have every whenj failed of their aim. In truth,
the courts o.i xidrope are too enlightened to be-
LJve that RmiL, aitdr having for so long a time
maiivaiued a pacific fydem in regard to Sweden,
had cho'irn'ts depm t f o a it, in the moment when
she was engaged in a War so feriousas that in which
th- Ottoman' Pm te had involved her.
In the mean time, the empreis, attentive to e
*ry thing which pa tbd in a place to adj cent to
territories, judged it necefihry, on the infor
mation which die received, not to neg’eTto take
m.af'ir-'s of oreeantion. But anxious to avoid e
very thing which might create umbrage or excite
alarm, flje contented kerfed"" with ordeiing to Fin
land a flight reinforcement of troops, mid withef
tahl’dimg, in this province, magazines, propor
tioned to their number, and tbdilpenDly necetfa
ry to their subsidence. In fine, reposing on “Jie
innoc nee and fe^itnde of .her intentions, on the
religions tenure of the perpetual treaty, lublifiing
between the empire of Rufeand"" the k ngdbm of
Sweden, and above ail, not knowing of any one
fubjeft of di cullion, open or concealed, between
the twd courts—the amicable correfppndence, on
the contrary, continuing as ufiml between them,
frt had undoubtedly every right to think, that
ftrnngas might Ire the ambition, the uaeafinefsand
envy of the Imperial powers, the true motives
which could impel the Swedish monarch to make
war on hery must bO reprefled by the respect to
good f.iith, which ought to actuate the hearts of
loverc'gns more even than of other men J by the
i mpofibili tv of giving any color of equity to the
flight which he wrfhed to give to his pa'fions; and
in fine, by the obstacle equally' ftron^ that of the
lolemn compact he had made with h's people, not
to undertake any war without afiembling, con
luu ing. and obtaining the content of his fubjefts.
Nothing could-prove more eltbftually the fatiP
faHion which flfould have been placed in her Irn
penia' majafiy’s various aifuranchs, than the refo
lation which she took of detaching from the fleet
dellmed for the Atfchipelago a iquadion of only’
tmee ships, which the font to sea in the beginning
of this month, notwithft.mdmg the positive advices
.he had of ah the SwedHi fleer being cruizing in
the Baltic. These fh'rp ,three davs after their de
pT tm-efrom the port of Uronft.idt, fell'in, of the
file of Dago, with the Swedish fleet, which detach
ed a 1; .gate, the captain of which came aboard of
tec fliip ol the vice admiral Vanderfier, whocom
mnndeo this bttle fquadion. The captain efthe
ir'gateannounced to the vice admiral the prefehce
oi trie Duc de Sndermama, the king’s brother, the
commander of the Swedish fleet, and required to
faiute. 'f he vice admiral rep I .ed, that byth»‘i7th
a. tide Oi tnetreaty of Abo, no faiute could take
plr.ee between the Rulllan and Swedifh.fleets and
tmit i efpeftiug, in the pet Ton of the Duc de Suder*
mu ma, the cbtifm german of the einpreis, and the
biotnei ol the king of Sweden, lie had no difficulty
in rendering to thele diftmrtions all the honors
th. t were due. He then ordered a faiute of thir
teen guns, and lent an officer on board the Duc’s
hup to pay his Compliments, and to announce to
mm at. the fame time, that it was to his person
ony, that the honors were addreifed.—The an
iwer of the Duc de Sudermania was, that although
he was not ignorant of the tenure of the conven
tion made between the courts of Sweden and Ruf
fm, in regard to the faiute, be would not accept
of that which rvasto.be rendered, un'els given to
The Swedish flag, as he had received the nmd pre
eiic orders f-om the king, his brother, to make
tn.it flag tefpefted in every place, and on everv
occaflon.
I he empress had hardly time to make her cbm
pl.mt.. qii the inj office and if re gu lari tv of this pro*
celling to the court of Stockholm, when Ihe was
i formed of a proceeding still left expected. Oi the
di million ot her mmiller f; om the’ Swedish court
and teuitoiies. ,1 he pretended reaions of thismea
fuie are exposed in the declaration of the king,
made to the ministers of fmeign courts. Tl.efe rea
f-ms are not calculated loimpoie on themod tmen
rg.dened, and they therefoie require no anfu er
m>t one cannot help obfervihg, that it is the tint
example of the kind, by which a sovereign alihred
his (objects of the pacific and benevolent fentiinents
ht entertained towards them.
In the mean time the empress resolved to conti
mie io the last in the principles of moderation (lie
nau prolciied, confined her vefentment of this pro
cecumg to the -reciprocity which ihe was naturally
tmthmred o me .in j egard to rhe minitter of the
-mg of Seadn. She lignified to him to quit her
wont t in the fame /pacc of time which had been fix
ed lor her miniilcr ar Stockholm. The onT- dilfe

t<erd by the good faith which has accompanied the
came oi thecmprels, amUhe breach of faith which
has marxed tue whole condud of the kui<r ot <jwe

Notwithtlanding these feenes, which threatened
an mmoft inevitable war, the empress was pI A rs-1

of New-England, Mr. Adaihs.is. perfbftly at lie
fwre to fill a feat, for which ""native, education,
and the experience of feverak years at various
courts in Europe, have eminently and peculiarly
qualified him.
I he late improvements that have been made in
t.ie manufactmmg Awetican cbeefe, are proofs,
that the d>eefe does not owe its peculiar
good qualities to the foil, climate, or paflute of
Great-Britain. American cheeie, when kept e
qually long with the Engiifh, is equail- go->d. It
to be lamented, that the capitals of our farmer?
will not admit of their keeping their cheeie long
enough to bring them to perteftion, before they
expole them to lale. To remedy this inconveni
ence, woald it not be a good speculation for our
merchants, who have capitals, to purchase thd
cneele from the farmers, mid keep them two’ of
three years m houses prepared for that purpose?
It is m this manner the,Enghfh cheeie are bought
and ripened in Great Britain.
A correfpoudent informs us, that a new cheese
placeo in tne middle of a hay flack, or under a load
or two es wheat 01 rye in the straw in a barn, ri
pens, m the course of fix months, more than it will
mt wo years in any other iituation. The cheese
when taken out of the hay or straw, is changed’
from a white to a yellow colour, and is reduced
ne .rly one half in its thickness.

On the 17th, about noon, our fleet dis

packet boats attending, under the command
of the duke of Sudermania, whole ship

den, having allo in the fleet a vice admi
ral and rear admiral’s flag flying. Admi
ral Greig immediately gave the flgnal for
an attack, and our ships directly crowded
all the fail they could advancing towards
the enemy. The Swedes on perceiving
this, immediately formed into a line of
battle, ihe weather was serene, and our
ships profiting of a frelh fonth-eafl wind
.gained on the Swedes. flTe RotifTaw,
commanded by admiral Greig, attacked the
Swedish admiral but he retired towards
his small veliels; and it was not until a
bout 5 o’clock that our line were abreast
of the enemy, who then began to bear
down upon us. The firing immediately
commenced on both tides, and was continu
cd with great briskness until ten at night.’
The Swedes twice began to give way and
although during the battle there was a dead
calm, and that it was impofli'de to govern
the fliips, the fire was still kept up vmh the
greatelt intrepidity, and continned until
the night was far advanced, when the
Swedes began to haul up, and retired,
leaving our fleet matters of the field of bat’

The Emperor was lately thrown into a

at firft, but récolleting himfelf, inform
ed the Tuarks that his Majesty would cer
tainly sleep thatnight eight leagues from
Trielte, the road to Crofia, where they
would undoubtedly find him; if they
went. They thanked him, and actom

with equal admiration and surprise they
discovered that it was his Imperial Ma

ELIZABETHTOWN, May ar.
It has been remarked that the Ame
rican sheep yield much less wool than
the theep of Britain, France or Spain.
This is owing to the length of our
winters, and the quantity of snow on
the ground preventing their picking up
as much nourishment as the sheep in
Furope—hence they drop their wool,
from mere weakness during the winter
and {pring. 'Fo prevent this, a farmer
of long experience has found half a gill
of Indian corn every day to each sheep,
to be extremely ufeful, It firengthens
the sheep, by which means the quantity
of wool is increased, as well as retained
till the time of shearing, to the great
emolument of the farmer.

Extract of a letter from Richmond, June 26.
The amendments proposed in our con
vention for the consideration of the hi fl Con
gress under the new adopted government are,
chiefly, that the state shall have power to col
leftits own taxes,and payCongrefs by requisi
tions and it is expefted they will pals the
convention without opposition. Many of
the Federal party being equally inrerefted
with the Anti's in the objtfts of them—
though many fears are entertained of the
new Congress not acceding to these amend
ments—and such are the apprehenflons of
the holders of military certificates, finding
the certain resource, in their own revenue,
for the payment of the annual inteieft, likely
to be fuperceded by a national eftabhfhment,
that is uncertain in its operations and remote
in its effefts, that they are already felling out
at a lower price than when the constitution
was agitating. The convention we think
will break up to-morrow— —and on the next
day we (ball have a general rejoicing.
The intended proceflion for 4th of July,
vve hear, will be altogether Federal. No state
emblems are to be introduced into it. Ten
Tefpeftable gentlemen, at the bead of whom
n General Mifflin, are appointed to preserve
order. A short account of the progress of
the revolution will be given on flags, which
are to be carried bv citizens, on horseback.—
Mr. Wilson wil deliver an oration fuit^ble

ANNIVERSARY.
Yesterday, the anniversary of the Ameri
can INDEPENDENCE was commenced by
ringing of bells and, agreeably to previous
arrangements,there was a parade of thclight
horfe, artillery, and uniformed infantry, the
whole commanded by Col.Lewis,at 6 o’clock
in the morning. At i2h. the corporation
waited upon the prefidcnt of Congress, to
whom the recorder made a polite speech,
which was replied to by the president. At
this hour 13 guns were fired from the battery.
At one o’clock the honorable society of the
Cincinnati, with Col. DUER, the orator
of the day, escorted by the corps of artillery,
proceeded from th® City-Hall, to St. Paul’s
Church, where a large concourse of people
of all ranks and degreeshad assembled. Here
the auditory was addressed by the honorable
Orator, after a long exordium, in strains we
attempt not to describe. As the DECLA
RATION of AMERICAN INDEPEN
DENCE was the glorious event to be com
memorated on this occasion, no one will
doubt, but that the abilities, the acquired
rhetorical proficiency, and the oratorial inge
nuity of Col. DUER, were fuflicient amply
to grace the theme.
After the oration was over, the honorable
society of the Cincinnati, under the fame es
cort, proceeded to the mansion of his excel
lency the president of Congress, who was
congratulated on the joyous occasion, and a
salute of 13 guns fired in honor of the day.
Here an elegant collation was provided for
the foreign ministers, the corporation, the
Cincinnati, the militia, the artillery, and all
forts of persons.
From hence the proceflion moved down
Queen-street, and up Wall’ftreet, to the
City-tavern in Broad-way, where the mili
tary were dismissed, and the Soiccty of the
Cincinnati partook ©f an elegant entertain
ment, where the following toasts were drank:

VIENNA, May 10.
In the subsequent accounts received from
Prince Lichrenftein, o( the hte attempt to
storm Dubican, he bellows great commen
dations on the bravery and ardour of the
Austrian troops, declaring that had not
Major General Schiaun, on whom the
command of that detachment devolved,
upon Major-GeaeralKhun\being wound
ed been mortally wounded himfelf, he
would certainly have forced his way into
the town.
In the general aftion, which followed
this unluccefsful attempt, the Turks ad
vanced so near the bayonets of the Au
strians as to be able to reach them with
their fpcars. Neither lide seemed inclined
to give way, till the arrival of M, jorSchu
birfchjwith a squadron of the Kinfky light
horf when the Turks were totally rout
ed.
The loss of the Andrians in these actions
amounted to two lieutenant colonels, one
captain, 117 non-cQmmiffioned officers and
privates, and. 67 horses killed and thre£
lieutenant-colonels, two captains, four
lieutenants, 391 non commiffiuned officers
and privates, and 67 horses, wounded
Ten privates were miffing, and two pieces
of cannon were taken by the! urks during
the attack.
The loss of the Turks is computed at
upwards of 900 men killed, and the Auftri
an* took one I’urkih ftaudard.*®
Advices from lieutenant general Fabrici-
Ws, who commands the army in Transyl
vania, mention that on the 20th, 26thand
27th of April, leveral bodies of Turks,
amounting together t<> 2500 men, attacked
different parties of the Austrian troops,
polled in the neighbourhood of Terz
bourg, but finding they could gain no ad
vantage, thev retreated, leaving 46 men
(lightly wounded.
Frequent fkirm’Thes also happen behv«n
the Austrian volunteers ported at Croaks, in
the Bannet, and the Turks, in one of which
the former lately made 12- prisoners, and
took a standard.

Extract aof letter from Kingfon, Jamaica,
i^th of May 1788.
Our political ferments are now pretty
well over, and I think likely to continue
so, during General Clark’s adminirtation.
Our last general election gave the people
an opportunity of returning manymembers
who were highly deierving of feats in the
affembiy, and who have done much for
the eftablifhmeut of our inlular credit,
which was certainly in a rapid decline.
Our crops this fealon are in general plen
tiful and I have great hopes that another
year will witness the prosperity of Jamaica
in its zenith. g
You will observe by our papers, that
we have taken the alarm at the proceedings
of the hair brained zealots at home refpeft
ing the slave trade. For some time at firft,
we were rather panic struck at the uncom
mon appearance of this phenomenon but
having received from the firft impreflion,
a spirit of resentment against our illiberal
calumniators is become lo general, that it
will not be easily allayed. I hope, and
pray,that parliament will not do any thing
farther this fefiion, than receive th* peti
tions, as I know nothing they could do in
the present stage of the bufinefs,that would
not be attended with a bad effect.’’

elegant address to the president
Reverend and learned Sir,
I CANNOT refrain exprerting the high

The evidence of.gcnius and learning, this
day exhibited by the young gentlemen who
are now proceeding from hence into the

advantages of an university education, irre
sistibly carries my best wishes with them.
I anticipate, with great plealure, those future

abroad, and triumphing over cruel invaders
at home when we fee, by the learning here
acquired, religion Gripped of that delusive
and dangerous garb, which ignorance and
superstition had wrapt her in
and exhibited, in that simple and unaffected
dreis, in which alone she can honor the de

deeply revere our ancestors, and rejoice
in the fair inheritance they have tianfmitted
us.
I am obliged on this happy occasion, to
indulge myfelf to be carried on the wings of
imagination, to the time faft approaching,
when such attention will be paid to this le
minary, that new colleges will be hereereft
ed, the ufeful profefforfhips encouraged and
fufficiently endowed, while the domes shall
be thronged by youths, thirsty for science,
our country inriched by profound erudition,
be acknowledged by the world as the princi

From your learning and known ability,
respectable fir, your fellow citizens have
formed the mo ft {anguine expectations, that
while you hold the ifation you now fill with
so much dignity, you will annually fend
forth men formed to guide the cabinet, direst
the arms, and extend the commerce of their
country and those also, who by their pre

perpetually transmit public and private
happiness from one generation Lo another.

His Excellency the Governor, at the re
commendation of the general aflembly, has
issued a brief, to be read in the several reli
gious societies in this commonwealth, for a
contribution, to carry into effeft the bene
volent purposes ment.oned imthe following
petition of the society for propagating the
golpel among the Indians, &c.
To the. Honorable the. Senate, and the Honor
able House of Representatives, cf the Conr
monweadth of ■Mafjachuf tts,
THE Society for propagating the sof
pel among the Indians and others, in North-
America, beg leave to Ihew, that one design
of our venerable Fathers in emigrating to
this land, was profeffedly to extend the
knowledge of our Gloriousßedeemer among
the Savage Natives: that this design wa*
expressed and enjoined under both the
charters granted by the parent state to this
colony, and is, in the opinion gs the Socie
ty, necessary and suitable at all times to. be
pursued by a 'people whoprofefs chriftianity*
That the end for which this Society
was instituted by the legiilature, was to at*
tend to this important circumstance, and
prove to the European world, who are at a
great expence in pursuing this objeft among
us, that wc were not inattentive to it. It
is the desire, the design, and the ambition of
the Society, to pursue the ends and purpo-
fes for which they were incorporated.
I he want of funds alone prevents them
from exerting themselves in propagating the
Gospel among the Indians, and extending
the means of Chrlftian knowledge among
those of the inhabitants of this land' who ar«-
now destitute of them.-
They humbly request your honors to re
commend to his Excellency the Governor
to issue a brief, to be read in all the churches
of this commonwealth, requesting the aid
of all piouffy dilpoled pvrfons, in carrying
on this truly benevolent defign* and alking
their contributions, in Ipecie, public securi
ties, ‘or any other property, to enable the fo
cicty to fend the knowledge of our glorious
Redeemer, among those who are now pe*
riffling for lack of vision, and to extend the
means of inftrudlion to our fellow citizens
in the eastern and other parrs of the state,
who are now destitute of them.
The Society are not insensible of the
difficulties and embarrassments of the pre
lent day, and they are sorry to ask the aid
of their fellow citizens at a time f® distress
ing, but they cannot be easy to remain any
longer inaftive from pursuing the great ob
jefts of their appointment. The collections
upon this occasion will be free, and thOy do
not wiffi them to be so large as to caufc
distress to any. A mite thrown into tht
treasury of the Society by every individual
in the state, would amount to a large sum,
and would enable them to publiffi the glad
tidings of great joy among those who
now fitting in darkness and in the region of
the shadow of death.
“Your honors will pardon the Society
for addressing you on this occasion, and re
questing this favor at your hands they can
scarcely suppose, however, an apology to be
necessary for applying to Christian rulers
upon a fubjetl which relates so immediately
to the honor of the author and fiiaifher of
our faith. Your honors will be pleased t»
observe, that the Society are not asking a
favor for themselves, but are supplicating
for thofc, who now fuffer in their best in
terest they arc beseeching your honors to
pursue a design of which our venerable fa
thers have loft fight, and to do what may
be highly acceptable to that Being, upon"

SAMUEL SALTUS,
In consequence of the foregoing relolntions the
committee therein appointed met in Sunbury the
25th day of September, J 78S, and recommended
to such gcntl?nien as mean to upport the tailing
of the proposed tr oop of light horse,
That they fnbfcri,be an obligation, binding them
fclvcs to pay into the hands of the committee,
.monthly, a (urn in proportion to the value of their
property, as recommended in the before mention
ed resolutions. The committee find it impossible
to alcdrtain ths exact sum that each individual
must pay until they know the amount ol property
held-by the fubfoibers; when that can be furniffi
ed, a fair Rate of the whole will be laid before the
public. The expence of the company, independ
ent of rations, will be about 1651. per month,
rations and forage will amount to about 961. But
there fearcely being a doubt but that the fpecific
tax will he allowed for the last purpose, the ex
pence of this eftabliffiment, though so far superior
in number, will not exceed the former expence of
Capt. Lewis’s. And as there is the greatest rea-
Ton to expert assistance, by fubfeription from
Chatham county, it may (till be less; at all events
its eftabliffiment is now abfdutely neceftary. Should
the number of men not be compleat, or any other
Rivings made, of course the committee will ac
count to the fubferibers for the fame. Hqnry
Wood, E- H. Schmidt, Peter Winn, and John
Couper, the committee.
We whole names are hereunto fubferibed do
bind and oblige ourselves to pay, monthly, into
the hands of the committee appointed for that
purpoie, our proportion, according to the forego
ing resolutions and the valuation of-our property
placed opposite to our names, and to continue the
eftabliffiment of a horse company the firft month
ly payment to be on or before the 31st day of
October.
NPW-YORK, Nov. 6.
Extra ft of a Letter from a Gentleman in the. State of
Majfacbufetts, to his Friend in this State, dated slugujl
*l9,' 1788.
Great are the hopes of the people here from
the new lyilem of national government. General
Wjsbinctok is universally talked of for Prefi
dcntoftlfe United States; and, so far as I can
find, the judicious and sensible people in this com
rntmXvealth, turn their thoughts on John Adams,
F,fq. our late Ambafiador, for Vice President.
The great knowledge of Mr. Adams, on the' fub
jeet of politics, is the admiration both of Europe
and America. His particular acquaintance with
the Princes, the Ministers and the views offeve-'
lai foreign courts, rauß no doubt give him an ad
vantage, \vhich few, if any besides him, have been
able to acquire; added to this, his uprightness
and inflexibility, where the good es his country is
concerned, stamps a dignity on.his character,
which, next to the’ services he has rendered to
America, will make his name precious to the latest
ages. Considering of what importance it is that
the affairs of this country, in the firft eftablilh
ment of a new fyflem of government, Ihould be
committed to those, of whole integrity and abili
ties we have had full experience for years pad,
how much is i\ to be wished that this wife and
great man may not only have a feat assigned him
in the new Congress, but this of such dignity, as
may correspond with his worth, and convince the
world, that the great men in America, are the
wile a*d good men of the age, the patrons of
liberty, and the friends of all mankind?
O’ The MAIL for ENGLAND will
be doled at the Poll-Office at Eleven
o’clock this Morning.
The Packet proceeds direct for Fal
mouth.
Yeilerday arrived the brig Amboy,
Regulator, White, Baltimore Sincerity,

Same day cleared out at the Cuftorh-
Hoiife, rhe schooner Priendlhip, White

ta, Bacon, Middletown.
We are informed that the stages have
again contracted to carry the Mail from
Porrfmouth in New-Hampihire to Peterf
burgh in Virginia.
On Sunday morning the 2.6 th tilt, died
at Bordentown, New-Jersey, Thomas
Read, elq. late-mailer of the Pnip Alliance,
and during the late war a captain in the A
mericannavy. While integrity, benevo
lence, patriotism and courage, united with
the molt gentle manners, are refpecled and
admired among men, the name of this va
luable citizen and soldier will be revered
and beloved by all who knew him. He
was, in the noblelt import of the word—
a MAN.
F.xirafl 'fa letter from an Trjb gentlemen
in the Ruffian Jet-vice, to bls Father in
Dublin, dated f rom the Borlfthenes, June
2 3-
My health being much impaired by
the disorder raging in Prince Potemplun’s
army, I obtained leave, through my patron
General Soltikow, to quit the army fora
time, and serve onboard the Ruffian fleet.
We had above a month’s cruise before we
could possibly invite the Turkish fleet to
face us; although, by good information,
and positive prooffmee, if was considera
bly itronger in force than ours, though I
believe not altogether so well appointed.
They firft appeared to us in the evening of
the 17th, in fine weather, to the wind
ward, and about three leagues nearer to the
Cczakow ihore. At day-break on the
18th, they bore down to the attack with
their heavy fliips a-head, and a relerve fleet
in their rear, commanded by their molt ce
lebrated naval officer, the Captain Pacha,
inclining rather firft to attack our second
or left division, which was to windward
of our centre, and commanded by the fa
mous American Commodore Paul Jones,
now a Rear-Admiral of Russia (who, be
his crimes what they may, is a most excel
lent and intrepid marine officer, and whofc
valor on this and the subsequent attack, 1
has obtained him valt honor). Our cen
tre division was compofcd of about 13 hea- 1
vy Imps and one frigate, on board of which
the commander, the Prince of Nafiau, di
rected his manoeuvres, attended by Count
Apraxin, Brigadier Rygas, and the cele
brated Comte de Dumas, one ofthePEench
officers who served under General Walh
ington in America; and the leeward or
right division, of eight or nine ships, with
gun and row-boats, was commanded by
Capt. Winter, a Dutch officer, who diflin
guiihed himfelf furprilingly, and got great
credit.
Soon after the firing commenced, Rear
Admiral Jones, then at some distance from
the centre, by a quick and great manoeuvre
in fhifting his politico, brought the enemy
between two fires, and there was smart
work for near an hour, when the reserve
ships led on by the Captain Pachei, got in
to action, and reanimated the Ottoman Tai
lors, but seemingly with much more intre
pidity and valor than skill for he had
hardly got into action before he was se
verely handled, and flanked by the chief of
the Rear Admiral Jones’ ships. Ihe con
flict was animated, until two of the d'urk
ifh ships blew up, and a third had taken
fire. Their left wing had been severely
handled, and by this Line thrown into dii
order, by the division under Capt. Win
ter. A fort of confufion seemed to per
vade the whole of their right and centre
w ings, which no efforts of their brave com
mander could put to rights their firing
relaxed, as ours became more animated
but by an accidental good j *iition, and a
favorable wind, most of th*.r ships efcapid
after a fix hours conflict, under cover of
the guns of Oczakow and Varna. This
has turned out a glorious day for our fleet,
and the allied armies. Ihe lols the 1 urks
have fuffained, both in fltip^ and men, the
division id dispersion of their remaining
fleet, and natural terror the diialter win
give, muff Icon, open an easy conquelt of
the garrison of Oczakow and the circum
jacent country. We haver just heard that
the garrison ofVarna, immediately on re-
ctivmg the news, retreated into that of
Oczakow and that tqe squadron under
the direction of rear admiral Paul Jones,
has come up with a part of the ihattered
fleet near Varna, and taken two ships more,
with the unfortunate Captain Pacha, the
commander in rhief, and the Ottoman in
vincible banner.”
On SUNDAY next the 9th inst. a CHARITY
SERMON, will be preached, and a colleriion made

OF RIEND, amid’ this transient Scene,
Of intermingled j oy and woe,
Still learn to keep a foul serene,
Nor {well too high, nor fink too low.
Whether involv’d in thought you fit,
And pensive mule the hours away;
Or ’midit the flow of wine and wit,
At ease indulge the feital day;
Within your favorite bower reclin’d,
Around where frelheft odors breathe,
Where varied Ihades aloft are twin’d
And limpid waters purl benedth
Here be the sparking goblet crown’d,
The liberal board with garlands dreft
Be fhort-Uved roles fcatter’d round,
While fate permits you to be bleft.
Too soon your villa’s {lately pride,
And all the useless wealth you Spare,
Your Spreading lawns, and meadows wide,
Shall go to glut some unknown heir.
All mortal-born, alike our doom;
The prince, the peasant, and the {lave,
Alike all journey to the tomb;
In dust all mingle in the grave.
PORTSMOUTH, (N. H) June 24.
The joy which the ratification of the Nqw Con

Joy fat on every face without a cloud,
As in the day oi op’ning Paradise.”
Mutual congratulations took place, and public
thanks were returned in all churches. It being
Lord’sday, no other testimonials ofjoy tookplace
until Monday morning at one o’clock, at which
time the bells rung a joyful peal, several citizens
paraded in the streets with music, fainting the
Members of Convention, (who had returned from
Concord) other patriotic characters, &C.
Information being received that his Excellency,
Prefideiit LANGDON, was to arrive, in town yes
terday afternoon, Colonel Wentworth’s Corps of
Independenthorfe, Capt. Woodward’s company of

number of gent emen in carriages and on horle
back, met his Excellency at Greenland, and es
corted him into town, where he was received by a
great number of citizens, who complimented his
return with several federal cheers. During the
prooeffion’s moving into town, the bells were
rung, and every tefliinony of joy exhibited,
which 'a grateful people are capable of expressing
or a federal patriot is worthy of receiving.
When his Excellency and suite arrived within a
mile of the town. Captain Woodward’s company
of artillery honored him with a federal Salute.
What added greatly to the brilliancy of the feene
was the appearance oi a great number of ladies,
whole fmiling countenances bespoke that congenial*

Composed for the 4th July, 1788.
O F their tutelar faints let the nations be vain.
And call their mock laintfhips divine
Let them bow, if they will, to the ideal train

Oh, day of delight, to Columbians so dear,
Long may thy rich benefits last 1
May this signal period in each’ci rtf ling year,
Be kept and enjoy’d like the past.
Here Thirteen are met with a patriot design
To honor an sera so great,
Here freedom and similar sentiments join—
May such concord pervade every state.
In freedom and bleft Independence lecure,
Ojir prosperity scarce is alloy’d
So vast aprofufion of favors, is ^ure
More than country has ever enjoy’d.
But one thing is needful; a government free,

This land most adopt, or, alas! ws Ihall fee
An end to its greatness e’re long.

On this awful occasion we challenge you forth,
In defence of the Union to stand;
Thole anti’s arrest, in their daring career,
Who for gain wou’d their country undo
From them we have every thing evil to fear.
And all things to hope for from you.
Now let the charg’d glafles go chearfully round,
Thro’ this little republican band-
In such friendship and firm unanimity bound,
May the Thirteen fair Pillars e’er stand.
In hilarity thus while we spend this bleft day,
While we raise the bright burfipers on high,

A Farmer from Ulster County informs, that he
lowed a considerable quantity of ground with the
yellow bearded Wheat, and that it answered his ex
pectations fully; the infedt not committing the
least .depredation on- a single spear of wheat. But
that his neighbors having lowed the white and the
red bearded Wheat, was almost all cut off. This
circumstance, which is known to be true, affords
a corroborating proof of the assertion of Colonel
Morgan.
A Character.
(Written 15 years ago.)
LORD Mansfield is perhaps the only man in Eng
land whole capacity is never' disputed. In this
refpeft, courtiers and patriots are alike lavilh in
his praise. His talents,- notwithstanding, are
somewhat equivocal; and if properly examined,
will be found to be below that standard at which,
they have been fixed by a long prescription. The
nervous oratory of Chatham has not-unffequently
difeoncerted him; a^d when opposed by the culti-’
vated powers of Lord Camden, his agitation fililf
ciently difeovers, that he dreads him as a fuperi'or,
An imposing maimer, an insinuating voice, lin'd the
quicknels of his eye. are the chief ingredients of
his speeches when examined in the closet have^ft
their charms. We are surprised, how we could
have heard with applause, what we read without
pleasure. We difeover in them no ingenuity, or
strength of argument, and no force or eloquence
of expression. The rapidity with which he pro
ceeds in the decision offuits, has been ascribed. to
theaentenefs of his parts: it is a con sequence, how
ever, of his experience inbufinefs; and while he
has been (educed by it to pronounce suspicious,
and sometimes contradictory judgments, it will
prove a source of fruitful mistake to bis fucceflbrs.
More verfant in the Roman than the Euglifli juris
prudence, he is more guided by general rules of e
quity, than by principles of law, and he is apt to
aflame an unpardonable latitude in the interoreta
tion.of (tatutes. He would bend the aCls of the
legislature to the diferetion of a Judge. A favor
er of arbitrary power from education and princi
ple, he beholds the progress of liberty with a ma*
hgnanteye. In a fit nation where he mightadvance
the interest of his countrv, he plants its deftrußL
h e preserve the elTential parts of
the Constitution, he Sacrifices his integritv to party
While he fliould be moderate, he is ext'ravacant
Hetofters by his counsels the diftraftions of the na
tion, and gives rife to those perpetual indiferetions
which di [grace administration. His hefltating and ir-.
resolute temper, he seems to have communicated
to the partisans of government, measures are a
dopted, now bold and atrocious, now timid and
Scrupulous. His condmft, if we could doubt for
a moment his attachment to defpotilm, appears
calculated to precipitate from his throne, a Prince
whose facility of temper is greater than his pene
tration. A reputation for which he has been in
debted to the extent of his memory, and to the pos
session of (hewy rather than Solid parts, mud ne
ceflarily decline. His fondneSs for glory will prove
to him a Source of contempt. The favor of his
Sovereign will not prelerve him from the detesta
tion of his fellow citizens. The contumely and
reproach, which are about to oppress him at the
verge of life, will atone to his country for ho
nors, which he has execlfed to its prejudice and
for a renown, which he has enjoyed without de
serving it.

Tucfday night lali, between 11 and 12 o’clock,
a fire was discovered in a large dwelling house at
the south end of the town, belonging to John
Brown, Esq. which was occupied by four families.
The lire had got to luch a height before a difeove
j y was made, that the unfortunate tenants (about 20
in' number) were obliged instantly to quit the house,
molt of them with only their ffiirts—very few ar
ticles of furniture were therefore saved from the
■devouring flair.es. A young man who leaped from
a ganet window was lomewbat hurt, and another
considerably burnt in effecting his escape through
the kitchen, where the hie began. 3he fire-com
panies and other inhabitants assembled with their
usual alartnels, but the only attainable object was
to save the houles of Mr. d'homas Bennet and
Captain Benjamin Dexter, which were each about
40 feet distant from the house in flames, and the
only ones immediately endangered thereby; these,
with the affidance of the engines were with diffi
culty preserved.
A lubferipnon has been opened for relieving
the families who hove loft their whole property by
this distressing accident, and we are happy to learn
that a confiderablc sum is already fubfenbed.
Mr. Bennet, and the family of Capt. Dexter
(himfelf being absent) leturn their sincere and grate
iul thanks to the inhabitants, for the fuccclsful ex

The idea of the Marquis de la Fayette’s being
at the head of 6000 men, as mentioned under the
London head, is not to be credited. 3’he fatf
is—the Marquis has been induced by his patriotism
and love of liberty to inteieft himfelf in favor of
those who oppose the new edifls; in consequence
of which, his Moll Chriflian Majefly has teftified
his displeasure, by depriving him of his office of

On the 4th inflant, the honorable the general
aflembly of Pennsylvania adjourned, fine die.
The harmony with which the late sessions of
aflembly has terminated is a most comfortable
circumfiance to every friend of good government.
The two federal chara&ers which have been elefl
ed tp represent Pennsylvania in the senate of the
United States, and the concordance of all parties
with refpeQ to the law passed by the house, regu
lating the time, place and manner of choosing their
eight members of the federal house of representa
tives, and the eleflion ol the ten elefters of the
president, are good omens of future happiness un
der the new constitution.
The electors of the president of the United States,
on the part of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
are to meet in the borough of Reading, where it is
universally hoped and expeßed that one more tri
bute of merited approbation will be given to George
Waflungton, Esq. bv their unanimous Suffrages.
Of the several refpeflable chambers in nomina
tion for vice-president, circumstances fecm most
to concur in favor of John Adams, Esq. While
the conciliating talents of Governor Hancock, and
the attachments to him that prevail in Massachu
setts, render him neceffaiy to the peace of New-
England. Mr. Adams is peifcblly at leisure to
fill a feat, for which nature, education, and the ex
perience of several years and various courts in Eu
rope, have eminently and peculiarly qualified him.
We have the following paragraphs from unques

while they were in great disorder, some of them
being aground and unable to manoeuvre, burnt fix
of them, among which was the admiral’s and vice
admiral’s, took two more,and between 3 and 4000

in a small veffel,and loft his standard and has since
retired to Varna, with the remnant of his fleet.
The Ruffian force on the Black Sea confifis of
three fliips of the line and five frigates, under the

The Empress of Russia has formerly declared war
against Sweden. She expefls to derive assistance
from the king of Denmark, who has been arming
with great activity, and has a powerful fleet. It is
expefied that Sweden, Inouid the proposals for a
general peace prove abortive, will be supported by
England, and the Turks, while it is known that
Prussia lias promised effcfioally to fuccour her.
The cabinet of Verfaiiles have it in contempla

commanded a (hip on our coafl.
From all the accounts that could be collefled, it
appears to have been a well fought battle, in which
the commanders on both sides have difimguifiled
-them(elves. 3'he Swedilh vice-admital, Comte

OUR accounts, or rather history, of the Con
vention at Poughkeepsie, were continued last
Thbrlday to Friday the ^th, from which to Mon
''day, July 7, they went through the remaining ar
arricles of the Conflitution.
As amendments to the genera! fyflem bad been
proposed from time to time, in the course of the
session, it now remained to have them arranged and
flared, .which occupied Tucfday and Wednesday.
On Thursday the Convention met, when Mr.
Lanfmg came forward with the amendments ar
ranged in three claffcs, viz. explanatory,
conditional and r e'C bSimend ato ry A
'bill of rights was clafied among the explanatory
tire conditional were, that therefould be no fland
ing army in time of peace without the cons ent of two
thirds of Coygrefs that, there [kail be no direEi tax
es, nor excises, on American man'ufaElures thAt
the militia flail not be ordered out of the fate, ex
cept by the previous cons nt of the executive thereof;
nor then for a longer time than fix weeks without the
nnfent of the fate legislature —and, that there
fall be no interference in the eleEiidns, unless when
a fate Jhall neglect or refuje to provide for the
fam.
Mr.XinTing observed, after reading the amend
ments, that they bad been altered both in form and
fubOante, from the last report, particula ly that re
fpe&ing the apportionment of reprefentatiori ;it
now Hands that there fall be a representative
for every 30,000, till it got to boo j beyond which it
may not go.
Mr. Laufing proposed, that the Convention
fhouid adjoinn,arid that a committee of both parties
dlionld be informally appointed, who (houtd en
deavor to make such accommodation, and so to ar
range the amendments as to.bring the business to
a quick and friendly decision accordingly the Con
vention adjourned.
Mr. Jay, the Mayor of New-Yo k, the Chief
Justice, Judge Hobart, Judge Ryerfs, Judge Lef
ferts and Mr. Hatfield,on the part o f the federalifts;
and Judge Yates, Mr. Lansing, Mr. M. Smith,
Mr. Tredwell, Mr. Haring, Mr. Jones, and Mr.
G. Livingflon, 'hh the part of the anti-federalifls,
were the committee appointed in confequehce of
Mr, Lansing’s motion.
When the committee met, Mr. Jav declared
that the word conditional fhouid be erased before
there could be any difeuffion on the merits of
the amendment —-this occafiohed about
an hour’s debate, and the committee was diffolvcd
Without effetling any thing.

that, place on Monday la fl txtraEled from yefler
day’s Daily Advertiser. Of the genuineness of the
reps eftntat ion. the public will be belter able to
judge hereafter.]
TII E anti-federalifl* met frequently in the
course of last week in these meetings there was
much warm debate some were for rejeQing the
conflitution but the majority, more moderate,
Infilled on an adoption, with certain conditions
this at length was agreed on, as the extreme point
of conceflion. The plan was accordingly formed,
and brought forward in convention.
A motion was then made for an informal com
mittee to be chosen from both parties, tn order to
o ganize more contpleatly the amendments, and
to fix on some accommodating scheme for an adop
lion.
A committee was accordingly appointed, and
having met, inflcad of entering mutually on the
buGnefs, the anti-federal budget was immediately
produced and opened, and a complete plan of
adoption was presented as a single propofttion, for
the affcot of the federa'iQs, attended with a decla
ration that this was their ultimatum. No room then
remained for any general reasonings, but the mat
ter was reduced to a point, and the propositions
Were only to be alfented to or difapp'roved. Mr.
Jay, Judge Hobart and others, fhohgly opposed
the measure urged most forcibly that the proposi
tion led to a virtual and total rejeflion of the
conftituhon and deflated they coild not con
sult with them,at all, if they infilled upon that
point. Both .parties were fiim, and the com
mittee dissolved without coming to any agree
ment.
On Friday Mr. Jav came forward with a state
ment from the informal comrhittee representing,
that no plan of concilia ion had been for med, &no
measure taken, in tohfequence of the anti-federal
jflsadhering rigidly to the principle of a condition
al adoption, which was inadmimble and abftird.
He went into a confidrration of ths nature and
tendency of such an adoption compared it with
the powers delegated to this convsntion, and the
powers of the future congress and inferred, that it
would amount in result to a total rejeflion. He
called on the opposition repeatedly to answer his
arguments. He was answered by Mr. Smith and
Mr. Lansing, who attempted to prove that the
convention, as the representatives of a sovereign
people, had a power to agree to the constitution,
tinder any reftrifiions and qualifications which
should be thought expedient. They infilled that
the congress would have a right to restrain the ex
ercise of any power giveri them by the. conQitu
tion :—that it was in the power of any legillature
to apply a different mode of imposing burthens on
different parts of the state, according to circum
flances.
The Chancellor, in the cotirfe of this debate,
affirmed a mode of reasoning a little different, but
not less impressive than that of his worthy col
leapnc.t He, appealed to the apprehensions and
passions of the Convention painted in the rhoft
glowing colors the unavoidable corivulftbus of dur
ihte the depreciation of our currency the great
Joss arising from the removal of Congress from odr
capital; and the various disadvantages of being
deprived of a voice in the counsels of the Union.
0$ StAirday morning, Mr. Jay opened the bu«
ftneis by uprefenting the unfair,nefs of the pro
ceedings in the informal committee. He complain
ed that when met for mutual difeuffion, they had
been insulted bv complete set of propositions
nrefented in a diSatofl al. rdanper fdr their passive ac
o'-mfeepce. He was toon} followed by Mr. Ha
mdtsn, who in a moll argumentative and impaf.
fioned address, demonstrated, that the proportions
before the committee, would bea total rejection of
the conflitution. Fie opened with a beautiful ex
ordium, in which he described, in a delicate but
fnoft affebling manner, the various ungenerous at
tempts to prejudice the minds of the convention
against him. He had been represented as an am
bitious man, a man Unattached to the interefls and
infen'ible to the feelings of the people and even
his supposed talents had been wrested to his dilbo
nor, and produced as a charge against his integrity
and virtue. He called on the world to point out
an inflance in which be had ever deviated from the
fine of public and private dutyv The pathetic ap
peal fixed the fifent fimpathetic gaze of the fpeSa
tors, and made them all bis own.
Fie then proceeded to refute the fallacious rea
sonings of oppofitiou and‘ to describe the nature
and tendency of a proVifional adoption. He proved,
in'the firft place, from the series of papers on which
the authority of the present convention was founded,
that it had no possible decisive power, but to adopt
or reject. absolutely that ft had indeed a power to
recommend, because this was the natural right of
eVcry freeman but it had none to dictate to Or
embarras the union by any reftnftions or conditions
whatever: that the committee was nota body com
miflioned to tender flipulatioris or.form a compafl,
but to dissent from or agree to a plan of government,
which could be altered either in its form or exer
ciTe, only by an authority equal in all refpefiis to
the one which gave it exigence. Having made
this point dear, he went on to lhew,that the future
Cotigrefs wbuld have rib authority to receive us in
to rhe union on fu ll terms that this conditional
adoption included evidently a disagreement to and
rejection of a part of the constitution that Con
gress, which would holdall the powers it poss ffed
under the conftitmion as a simple plan.muft cb Tider
such a partial rejection in the light of a total one.
That a declaration by any Jegiflatme that such
and such eonftititional powers fhouid not be exer
cised, was in its own nature a nugatory one t that
thele provi fiors, making fib part of the conflitution,
and when accepted by Qongrefs, having, even if
confident with the conflitution, n 6 other than a le
gal force, would be fubjefi o an immediate repeal
that it was indifpendibly neceflary t» good govern
ment, that the diferetion of the legislature fhouid
be uncontroulable, except by the conflitution but
by the proposed measure, the diferetjon of Con
gress would be limited and controule^ bv a provisi
on not only foreign from, but totally inconfifterit
with the conflitution a'provifion coming from a
part of the union without the consent of the other
parts a provision molt prepofleroufly calculated to
give law to all the filler Hates. Fie adduced other
arguments to prove, that restraining the exercise of
a power, Or exercising it in a mode different from
that pointed out in the form of government, was
utterly anti-conflitutional, especially when the re
flraint was only to refpeft a part of the commu
nity.
Mr. Hamilton then urged many forciblereaions
to prove, that even if it were confident with the
conflitution to accept us on^thofe terms, it was en
tirely improbable that the other slates would submit
to it. Their interefls and their pride would be op
posed to it. Their pride, because the very prono-
fal is an insult and the anitnofity of some Rates
embittered as it is by what they deemed a kind of
cornmercial tyranny, and a fyflem of felfilh, partial
politics, would receive moll pungent gratification
from a diminution of our fortune and our power.
Their intereflj would be oppdfed, because the mis
fortunes of one powerful Rate commonly contribute
to the prosperity efits neighbours.
Mr, Hamilton, after recapitulating his argu
ments in a concise and cogent manner, entreated
the convention, in a pathetic fltain. to makes so
lemn pause, and weigh well what they were about,
before they decided on a fubjefl so infinitely im
portant. The orator then closed his addrels, and
received, from every unprejudiced fpe&atdr, ""the
mtsrmur of admiration and applause.

the British name in India, he thus contraft.i
them by a retrofpeftive view of former go

It was not by such means that the Eng

when the natives of Indo han held the en
gagements of an Englishman to be unaltera
ble they represented him with all the'attri
butes of prowess in war, and of justice in
peace thus confidence and veneration were
so mingled in their eftimatiori of him, that
their sensations of security were stronger un
der an English authority, than under the best
of their native pi iheed. In those days, the
purse of the individual was ever open to the
public exigency, for every individual confw
ded in the faith and credij. of the public.

small arms, met with the fnlleft approbation.
Tueklay his Royal Highness reviewed the 4th,

through the manual exercise, firings, and a great

actnefs, that did honor both to the officers and
men.
After the review, the Prince returned on board

Of which his Highness is a member, being to dine
together at the Barracks of the 4th regiment, his

from all the King’s fliips in the harbor, and from
the Governor’s yacht. The fliips yards were hahd

after the salute gave three cheers.——Commodore

S I R,
I HAVE the pleafare of communicating to you
a fuccefsful case, in which I had the tatisfaciion
of Observing the return of animation to a youbg
person, who on Saturday lalt fell out of a boat and
was drowned, in about 12 feet of water.—A mart
at some distance saw him fall overboard, but atfuft
thought he dove in, to bathe, as the day was very
warm but ebferVing him to rife and fink two or
three timet, he apprehended the lad was in dan
ger, and ran to save him but before he could
reach the place, he was funk to the bottom. Two
men dove in after him, but could not recover him.
Some time was spent to obtain a boat-hook, with
which after several attempts, the body wks taken
Up.
A meflenger was immediately lent for the near
est physician, Dr. Kaf, and anothef was lent for
me. Before I arrived, the body had been rolled on
a barrel, and (hook with the Iread downward, and
I was told considerable water came 'from the
mouth.—l had the body conveyed as fdoh as pofli
ble to a room, at which time the physician who had
been fentfor Came in f without delay, we took off
the wet clothes, and ptirfued the-methods of treat
ment fecommcnded by the Humane Society, for
the recovery of persons apparently dead. After
the means had been used about an hour, an indif
tinft tremoi' was perceived in the pulse, and the
body began to acquire warmth. The application
oi fnutr and volatiles to the nole, procured consi
derable agitation. In an hour and a quarter; or
twenty minutes from the time when wo firft began
to uie the means-, the lad was fufficicntly alive to
open Ins eyes but the return of animation was
attended with grea* distress, and with groans which
were heard in the Neighboring houses. SomCtinte
after he spoke but feenied bewilderech Through
the remainder of the day and the night following,
he was in great pain, thirffy and diftreifed forbteath.
In the morning the Doctor let him blood several
days afterward, 1 he complained of a soreness in hi*.
Itomach and bowels, probably owing to his being
rolled, and prefled hai don a barrel) when taken
out of the water aihethod of treatment, which
it is to be wished may be wholly omitted, in all ca
ses of this kind, as there is danger of deftrOying
the feeble remains of life, at that critical md
meftt.*
After the harry Wai dyer, I made more parti
cular enquiry into the^ircuntflances, and found
the lad was between twelve arid eighteen minutes
under water. Whert taken up, the people who
Were present declare there was no appearance of
life. When I firft saw him, tlie body was quite
cold, the head and limbs were torpid and hung as
thole ofaperfor quite dead.
While we were carrying him into a convenient
place, in order to purfuc the methods recommen
ded for recovery, there was a small groan, not
unlike that of One expiring. Words cannot eX
prefs the anxiety of the father, when he cams in
to the room where we Were endeavoring to reco
ver his drowned fon,much Jess can language describe
the feelings of the parent, when he beheld the re
turn of life.
I have, Sir, been femewhat particular, as this
is the firft case m which I have been a joyful wit
ness of the teftoration of one, who had, as it were,
passed the gate of eternity, and had not the neccf
fary aid been afforded, would no doubt; before
this time, have been silent in the grave. With'
great respect, I am, Sir, your’s, and the Society’?
molt obedient and humble servant,
JOHN LATHROP.
Boson, July 27, 1788.
Ihe practice of rolling a fubjeeft on a barrel,
Nnd many other methods of producing a violent a
gitation of the body, have probably been adopted
upon a mistaken notion of the admiflion of large
quantities of water into the stomach and lungs.—
The fact is, that in fubjefts recovered from appa
rent death, very little or no water has been found
to have entered the lungs and as to that which s
received into the stomach, it is evident that even
as much as is fuflicient to fill it, can never be
dangerous. And therefore every meafurc of this
kind, can have no other tendency than to injure
the organs, and impede the restoration of the cir
culations.

Btfion, AugTijl 20, 1 “8-8.
Gentle men;
AVE being appointed bythe association of tradesmen
and manufafturers of the towti of Boston, to write
to our brethren throughout the fcvoval ftat^s, do
now address you oh the very important apd iiiter
efting fubjeA of Otir own manufafturds.
The late fyflem of Commerce pursued fifice the
peace of importing fifeh articles as can be manu
fatlured among ourselves, tends to diltourage the
Whole body of tradesmen and manufacturers of
these dates, who depend for the support of then,
felv.gs and famides on their various occupations
arid this practice, unlcfs fpcedily check’d by the
prudent exertions of those who are more particu
larly inte:efted, nrnft eventually prove ruinous to
every ifie’chanical branch in America.
Impressed with these sentiments-, and finding the
evil daily increafmg—the tradesmen and manufac
turers of the town of Boston, awakened by a len -e
of the danger which threatened them, aflembled
to* deliberate on meaftnes to relieve themselves
from the <?eftrHdive tendency of fnch importati
ons.
An Affectation Wai accordingly formed, confid
ing of a representative from each branch/; and in
this body thqwhole manufacturing interest of this
town becomes an object of general attention.
The firft meafurc adopted by this aflociaiidp
was to pass refqlves refpeding the importation'of
certain articles from Europe by bur own merchants,
and numbers of Britilh agents teiiding among us
but knowing that nothing could be eftefted any
radical purpbfe; imlels we had .the authority di
the laws, we petitioned the legiflatme of this
state; praying that duties might be laid on the’fe-'
veral articles enumerated in our petition. In
cortfequence of Which application, our legislature
complied, in a great meafme, with our req’ueft; by
enacting laws for the encoin agement of industry
and for the promoting of our own manufactures.
However, as We are feitfiblV that our prelent
Htuatidn requires ad extensive co-operation to
coinpleat the purpoffis we wilh, wc take this me
thod to bring a cbnfedeiated exertion,
and doubt notfrdm a rihion of fentijiient the most
pdrmaiieat benefits may rife. We therefore ap
ply to yrtu, gentlemen, to lend us yOuWaftiflance,
and, like a band of brothers) whole inferefts aie
con netted, we beg you to join in such measures to
advance the gendral^good, as your pftidcnce fltall
suggest, and your Wildom dictate.
We would with fubmiflion, recomhieiid an alfb
ciation of your tfadelmen and manufacturers,
formed upon the most extenfi've bails, and support
ed upon the most liberal principles J we may then
hope the manufacturers of this country will flour
rilh, when each man becomes interested not osily
in his own branch, but in those of his brethren
encouraged by such extensive patronage, each in
dividual will be animated to pursue his bufifiefs
with alacrity, knowing that he afts in concert
with thole on whole friendlhip he can with confi
dence rely.
An affbeiation being eftablilhed in your state we
Ihall be ever happy to ©orrefpond with j and we
flatter ourselves from this fpcial intei eburfe, a
general harmony will prevail throughout the whole
manufacturing interest of this country.
As we hope to experience the good effects of the
late arts of our general court, we would recom
mend a petition for a similar purpole to .your le
giflature and from the known diipcfition of your
state to promote the welfare of America, we doubt
not some plan will be devised by your general as
sembly to prevent the importation of Inch ipecies
of articles as are commonly manufactured in A
merica.
We need not urge the neceffityoi some meafuies
being immediately taken by the whole confederacy.
The embarrallments of our navigation the large
debts contracted in Britain and the remittances
of our currency, all serve to put every real friend
to his country upon ferieus attention and if any
mode can be adopted to remedy these evils, we are
convinced no American will be backward in the
cauie, but will join heart in hand to promote the
delirable purposes.
The means we propose, we concieve, are calcu
lated to put each state upon deliberating on a fub
j^Cl highly important to the manufacturing inter
est and we cannot but hope that fume lading be
nefits -will acerue from the united voice of* the
tradesmen and. manufacturers of America.
These states are so extensive in their boundaries,
so various in their climate, and fb conneded in
their national interest, that if a plan could be a
dopted throughout rhe confederation for the ex
change of the produce and manufactures of each
date, we conceive it would serve to cement a
general union, and prove a means to promote the
interest of the -whole.
Tlie Mcrthern states might furnifh many articles
of manufactures which are now imported from
Europe; and in return might receive tiiofe fup
phes peculiar to the growth and climate of the
southern.
AmafTopiation formed throughout the states up
on so liberal a plan, would eftablifti many exten
sive branches of mannfaCtft'res; and if prosecuted
with fpiri.t, would put this country above the hu
miliating state of lavilhlng her stores of wealth to
promote the manufadure* of Europe.
We. with you to communicate this letter to
such towns of your state as you Hiuli think proper.
We are, Gentlemen,
With every sentiment of refped.
Your most obedient fcfvants,

To be continued.
Mr. CHILD S,
MANY of your readers are disappointed at fiud
mg lo valuable a piece of information as that of
Col. Morgan’s, reipeCting the infeCts destroying
the wheat, dife on tinned after one day’s publication.
The truth upon so very important a fubjeCt'hould
be carefully diffufed thro’ the country, and by be
ing repeatedly presented to their notice, flxould be
impreiled upon the mind of every farmer, who
should be inf ormed that Ct>l. George Morgan is
himfelf an experienced farmer, and a very accu
rate and careful observer, so that the molt entire
and the fuiieft confidence may be placed in his in
formation. You and every printer are therefore
requested to re-publiih his address, and to continue
it for feme time in your paper, to which you may
if you plcafe, add this caution—tluit the blcffmg of
this difeovery refpefting the yellow bearded wheat
will soon be loft, nnlefs thx farmers are very care
ful to preserve this kind of wheat pure from any
mixture with other kinds, which can only be done
by flowing it by itflelf, and not near to fields of any
other kind with which it will certainly mix, and
from that mixture gradually lose its valuable dif
tinciion, the hardness ofits Rraw,by which it is pre
fer ved from the infecß. B
THE HESSIAN FLY.
Mr. Childs,
OBSERVING a paragraph in your Daily Adver
tiser, addrefied For all the American newf
papen,” dated at Philadelphia, the 13th of June,
and signed A Lind holder—f am induced from
the fame motives with the writer, which I am lure
were good, to inform him that his idea; refpc&ing
the Heflian Fly are ill founded. As they may mil
lead others who have had no bpportunity to know
this deltruftive infect, I beg leave, through your
ufeful paper to refer him, and them, to the publi
cations of the Philadelphia Agricultural Society, on
this fubjeft, as they contain its true hiitbry. if
the Landholder will read thole publications, he
will be convinced that his address may do much in
jury to many,-who have not had the means of better
information however good his intentions' may
have been and for this reason I recommend to
all Printers, who have published his add refs, to
give this as a caution again it his recomn uniadon.

The party of Iprd John Townilienfi, confiding of

Of his petition was -That a question propounded
td~him by one of his creditors, at his left exami
nation, and the bankrupts aniwer to Inch questi
on, might be expunged from the proceedings under
the commifHpn of bankruptcy.
The question piopoied was, whether the bank
rupt had loft'sl. by a game at cards—to which he
acknowledged he had.
This application to the Chancellor became ne
cefiaiy, by a certain prbvifion m the bankrupt
laws, by which a bankrupt, who has left 51. at
one time at the game- of cards, and Topic other
species of gambling,. therein delcribed, is preclu
ded from obtaining lifts cert^atte.. The Chancel

Mri Childs,
IT is undoubtedly of some confequehce,in the
bufmefs which will soon be before the citizens,
I mean the choice p£their mlagiftrates, that both
lide's should. understand each other. It is neceilat
ry too, in order to give efficacy to the exertions
of those who are resolved to endeavour at reform
the ensuing election, cdutibuCy to avoid miftepre
fentatioir on the, one hand, and warmth on the
other. An Elector of the North ward, (who I pre
sume was one of the committee that wisted on
Mr. Maxwell) has been Io zealous in the interest
of Mr. Lewis, that he has made .a very unfair esti
mate of the terms in which Mr. Maxwell declared
Jus readmefs to give place to Mr. Lewis. Mr. Max-;
well,it is very true,,politely, (but in language fome
wbat peculiar to himfelfj told the committee that
Mr.Le wis,f rom his.fqpprior tale u is and-cohriddi qns,
was no doubt better qualified than him to perform,
the duties of ah Aide r.ma3!, and liqiport the, digni
ty of that. Ration. At any rate he was determin
ed not to cqnteqd with a gentleman, whole friends,
as tfie edmmittee wodejilj intimated, Ifo'd taken
effectual arrangements to j'ecuri bis eledtioii.. 1
.imagine, fir, that it will not be iieceflafry to at
tempt to aeqiiit Mr. Maxwell of the Charge oi' in~
ftij/ilrty in this bufmefs, tlw’ the Elector of the
North ivyd seems to'take pieafuie iw his attempts
to eftqblilh inch a charge. I believe there is not a.
gentleman who will read this paper, but can-ap
peal to his own feelings what,would have been his
probable condqtft in a similar fitiiation to that 111
.which >lr. Maxwell was placdd'. A party of Mr.
Lewis’s friends, (I believe that every’candid per
lon will udinit that a party bFMr. Maxwell's
would have been the most delicate'on fuch'an er
rand,) came toMr. Maxwell’s’, house to tell him—
What Why, truly, tlj.at.Jic was not vhv obje<ft
oft^-p- cheice^npr qft/jc/c whom they' reprbfcntcd
—that Goj. Lewis was the lier.o tinder Miofe cd
lour^ they intended to display the political flag,—
and that he would most cerAyjuly prevail,' fog they
had made .the difppfitien of the attack, and in full
confidence of vfifthly, were come geuerouily, and
..with the oliVe-brancb in their-hand^ to after Mr.
.Maxwell quarter, and hmiorable retreat, before
they mounted the battldnlents'and commenced,
the cannonade. Now,'Mr. Printer, cun it be
wondered at, that Mr. Maxwell, thus aflaikd,
ffiould difcqVer a little' irfofolution—that the ufu
ai iirmnei^ of his niind Ihoutd give way tog mo-'
mentary instability— I think not—But, Mr. Childs
you are called on to account for them a rente nt pf
Mr. Maxwell’s name, and the lubftitutiim of that
of Cok Lewis. I cbffrge? you, Mr. Printer, .an
ypu value .the reputation of your types,ffis yiVu
regard your profelfional consequence, to give up
the author of that foul deed. It coifld not have
been done by any of tire Colonel’s friends.- No
that was impofiible—How then could the extraordi
nary affair have happened— but I ajk pardon for the
unnecefiary question— I had forgot that ypu have
explained the whole mysterious ttanfaeiion as
After all, I take the biffinefs to Hand thus
Mr. Maxwell has not resigned, but ftamls.firm
Col. Lewis’s friends have proceeded too far (here
I perfectly agree with them) to reiinqmffi him
And Aiderman W y, like the Dutchmen with
the cow, while the disunion of those gentlemen
■wi l probably defeat the intentions of both) he
will oe earheftjy endeavouring to fill his pail. The
gentlemen so industriously engaged in the iiitereft
of CoL Lewis, have allured the’electors of the
North ward that he will -accept of no fe.es. This
unquestionably is geijerous in the'Colonel, fits
friends have nothing now left to insure his fuccefs
but to (wear that Mr. Mhkweli V/zW’refign and'
if he did not, tltat he. ought tq’do, so, ,fjnce it wifi
be luipomble for him to bear up .agaimt fuch'for
midabib opponents.
I wiffi to inform the Elecflor of the North wm d,
before 1 take my leave of him, that the true'Cale
donian Ipirit doqs not.comport witlvinftabili-tv. It
is the temper of the Caledonians tb look out -for
a good caulb, and when they 'Lid ""it, they do not
hesitate about trifles. In such a' eaufe tfiey will
of ten contend agaiuft unequal numbers, thinking
it mme honorable to fail reputably, than to live

FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
The rapid progress which the
federal Constitution has made to
wards completion, is as allonifhing
asitis happy. Ia the time of war,
when America was invaded by the
fi-ets and armies of Britain, the
instrument for uniting the States,
was not accepted in several years
afterit was submitted to the States.
This being the cale, it was hardly
to be expefed that a similar instru
ment would, in time of leizure and
peace, be compleated in a quarter
part of thetimie. A year hathnot
yet expired, since the proceedings
of the Federal Convention were
promulged—-and in less than a year
the most sanguine cou!d not have
expected its completion,

In inveltigating the causes which
gave lite to the happy form of
government which we shall ere
long be under, the Historian will
not forget the era of the late infur
retions in this Commonwealth:
The outrages committed by our
infatuated countrymen, on the one
hand, pi@ures in striking colours
the evils of anarchy—on the other,
the firmnefs and decision of Go
vernment in an eminent degree
demonstrated the benefits refule
-Ing to a commuaity from a prompt
energetic administration of pub
lick affairs, The infurreétions,and
the speedy quell of them, must be
considered as the causes of bring
ing in existence, at a much earlier
period” than would otherwise have
been a government which has al
ready been adopted by 10 States.
The aniverfary of our national
birthday, has this year been cele
brated with most diftinguithed
marks of Tederal feltivity.—By
the various toasts given, one fenti.
ment pervades the whole &&-=that
sentiment does honor to our coun
try—it is the sentiment of union,
paternal love and friendthip.—
They all with patriotism warm from
the heart, seem to cry,
«Hail InpereENDENCE hail Hehvn’s
next best gift.
To thatof life and an immortal foul
'The life of life that to the banguet high,
And ibbc;r meal; gives taste; to the bow’d
roof,
Fair-dream’d repose and, to the'cottage
charms,”’
From the ordeal in which it hath
been tried, the federal constitution
has comeout withadditicaal bright
ness—its purity has wrought cen
vi‘tion on its oppofers—and it
promises to be a gévernment which
will have more fuprorters than
any one ever yet eftablithed ia the
world--in proportion to the num
bers who are to live underit,
It is expelted that the Congress
undet the new government will
meee on the fi.tt Monday of Da.
ccmber next. The eyes of the
coniinent are upon the great Ame
rican Fabius tor Prefilent—ind
as Vice-President, his Excellency
c¢ur worthy Governor, and the
Hon. John Adams, ate the two
gentlemen spoken of generaliy.
Gentlemen who arrived here
vefterday, in the New-York pack
et, in 37 hours from that city, ia
form us, that there is a great pro.
bability that the Constitution will
not be ratfyed by the Convention
of that State, during their present
feflion; that an adjournment for
two or three months was tryingfor,
There arein the Conventionl9in fa.
vor,and46 against the Constitution.
The city of New:York, and the
country adjacent are determined to
adbere to the Union, even it their
Convention fHould rejeét the
Conflitution——and iantend ap
plying to the federal governmeat
for support therein. The federalifts
ot New-Y ork State, own g-roths
of the property.——and are more
nearly opposed to it, in pumoers.
The city of Newport;, and the
town of Providence, in the ditrict
of Rhoderlfland, will, we are told,
petition the firft Congress to divide
the State between Connelticut and
Maflachufetts.
The debatesin the Conventicn of
New-York, have been condudted
with a great degrecof warmth and
acrimony, than in any other part
of the Union. This retards the
business on which they were met-—
and unless bacifhed, will operate to
the reje€tion of the Constitution.
Our accounts from North-Ca
rolina are of a different complexi
on to those from New-York
The sister State of Virginia and
South Carolina will not vote her
felf out of the family.
A gentleman who was in Phila
delphia on the 4th inst. and saw
the Grand Proceflion in that city,
informs us, that it was an exibiti
on of magnificence and grandeur
and was condufled with the great
est order and decency. Provision
was made for 10,000 perfons—
but the numbers were so great,
that not one half could find re
frethment,

fefted their federalifm, by celebrat=
ing the adoption of the Constitu
tion by aine States in discharging
NINE cannon, NINE platoons of
mufquetry, and dricking NINE
federal toasts—The whole was
conduted with the greatest hare
mony and order,
It is said, that the French Minis
try are determined to ercourage
manufa@uring in the United Statey
of America, as they fay, the more
trade Greatrßritain has, the richer
she will be, which will make her
a stronger and more powerful
encmy to France, when these two
countries aré at war with each
cther buton the contrary, if they
can_ transfer the manuta@uring
business from Great-Britain to A
merica, and can be supplied from
thence, with rhe goods which they
now get from Great-Britain, that
they will thereby enrich this coun
try and lerve themselves, for as we
have an alliance with them, the
tich and stronger they can mzke
us, the more they will benefit
themselves. They observe, that
it will not lefTzn their present trade
with us, as we now take but fevwr
dry goods them, and that we
thali for many years continue their
customers for cambricks, wines and
brandy, &c.
They wish vs to have a navi
gation act, as they fay it will en
courage our shipping and encreafe
our seamen and thip carpenters
they fay then when they are at war,
we will be able to affilt them with
our ship carpenters and sailors 3 ia
short, they seem very fenlible of
the essential {ervice they have ren=
dered themselves by affiting us to
procure our indepeadence, and as
they fee we (hail become a great
and powerful nation; they like
found politicians court us for our
friendfhipia time. Weexpeltallo,
that manufa&urers with large capi.
tals,will come over to this country
from England and Ireland, &c.
and make cheir fortunes, and after=
watds return to Europe and enjoy
them.
It is thought that many pzople
of property in Great-Biitain, will
come here and build thips, in order
to reap the sweets of our carrying
trade, which would answer cheir
purpose well; they would without
damot, in that cale; build the ves
sels with the live oak of the fourh--
ern states, as itis found to last lon
ger than the oak of any other
country.
Foreigners by building veflels
in America, will require a less ca.
pital to manage the carrying busi
ness than it now does by building
their ships in Europe by this ma
ncgver they will make sure of keep«
ing the American seamen in their
employ, and wi'l at the fame time
make trade brisk in this country,
